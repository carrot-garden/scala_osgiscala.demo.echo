Simple Scala OSGi Declarative Services Demo

The demo shows how the BND Tools (http://njbartlett.name/bndtools.html) and 
the Scala IDE (http://www.scala-ide.org/) can be used, to build a OSGi based Declarative Services (DS) 
application in the eclipse IDE.

Overview:
- com.github.tux2323.demo.osgiscala.echo.api contains interface for a echo services as Scala trait.
- com.github.tux2323.demo.osgiscala.echo.client contains a DS component which refers the echo service.
- com.github.tux2323.demo.osgiscala.echo.impl a DS component which provides a echo service.

Open Issues:
- Need the OSGi bundle biz.aQute.bnd.annotation at runtime, because in scala supports no compile time annotations?
- Integrated the Scala Compiler in the ANT Build
- Add to SCM a repository with the Scala Bundles
